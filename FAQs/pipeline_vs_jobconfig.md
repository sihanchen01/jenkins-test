> what's the difference between job-config and pipelines? and what's the difference between groovy 
  and Jenkinsfile?

‚è∫ Great questions! Let me explain the differences:

  Directory Structure:

  jobs-config/ - Contains Job Definition Scripts (.groovy files)
  - Defines job configuration, parameters, triggers, build retention
  - Uses Jenkins Job DSL syntax (pipelineJob, parameters, properties)
  - Tells Jenkins "what kind of job this is and how to configure it"

  pipelines/ - Contains Pipeline Scripts (Jenkinsfile.*)
  - Contains the actual build/deployment logic
  - Uses Jenkins Pipeline syntax (pipeline, stages, steps)
  - Tells Jenkins "what steps to execute when the job runs"

  File Types:

  .groovy files (Job DSL):
  pipelineJob('test-pipeline') {
    parameters {
      stringParam('ENVIRONMENT', 'staging', 'Target environment')
    }
    definition {
      cpsScm {
        scriptPath('pipelines/Jenkinsfile.test')  // Points to pipeline
      }
    }
  }

  Jenkinsfile.* files (Pipeline Script):
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          echo 'Building...'
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Relationship:

  - Job config (test.groovy) creates the Jenkins job and points to the pipeline script
  - Pipeline script (Jenkinsfile.test) contains the actual work to be done
  - This separation keeps job configuration clean and pipeline logic readable

  Think of it as: Job config = "Job settings", Jenkinsfile = "Job instructions"
